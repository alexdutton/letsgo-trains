Automation
==========

*Let's Go! Trains* comes with four built-in controllers:

.. note::

   Only the first two of these currently exist. The second two are planned.

* The *Maestro* controller, for interacting with points servos and sensors via a `Pololu Maestro USB Servo Controller
  <https://www.pololu.com/category/102/maestro-usb-servo-controllers>`_.
* The *Powered UP* controller, which controls LEGOÂ® Powered UP hubs in trains.
* The *Network Timetable* controller, which attempts to route trains between defined stations
* The *Event Programming* controller, which can be configured with Python snippets to automate your layout in response
  to events such as sensors detecting trains.
